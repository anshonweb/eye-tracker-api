# üëÅÔ∏è Eye Lab: Gaze Tracker API

Eye Lab is an open-source tool to create eye-tracking usability tests. It started as a final undergraduate work for the Computer Engineering student [Karine Pistili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karine-pistili/) who made the prototype. The idea is to evolve it into a more complete and useful tool with the community's help.

The current version of the software allows users to create their usability sessions of a website, recording the webcam, screen, and mouse movements and use this information to find out where the user has been looking into the screen by using heatmaps.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Setting up project locally

The project consists of two parts, this repository contains the backend of the application, and the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/uramakilab/web-eye-tracker-front). Install it as well to have the full application running.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 1. Create virtual environment

Before installing all dependencies and starting your Flask Server, it is better to create a Python virtual environment. You can use the [venv package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to create a virtual environment. To create a new virtual environment, run the following command:

```
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Then activate your environment. On Windows for example you can activate with the script:

```
name-of-event/Scripts/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install all dependencies listed on the requirements.txt with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask API

```
flask run
```
